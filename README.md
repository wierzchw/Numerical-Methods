# Numerical-Methods
Two projects from numerical methods course on third semester

I project
Calculating integrals using trapezoidal quadrature.

II project
Solving a system of equations Ax = b with the Gauss-Seidel method using the Gauss elimination with complete pivoting where matrix A is block matrix given as 
    | I     A12     0 |
A = | A12   -A22  A23 |
    | 0     A23   A22 |
